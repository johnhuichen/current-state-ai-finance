# Mission and Value

This project focuses on current state of AI research in fundamental analysis as well as some interest in sentiment analysis. By providing better understanding of what is good and bad investment in the financial market, this project hopes to contribute to the stability of global financial market in the future.

It does not focus on short term predictions (e.g. price movement) or day trading strategy. Because price can be sensational in a short time period, predictions are dangerously speculative.

Some resources linked in the project may focus on automated trading algorithms or price prediction, and the readers should know that this project takes a neutral stance.
